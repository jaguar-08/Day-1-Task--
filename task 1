HTTP-Hypertext Transfer Protocol
HTTP was created in 1997.
first version of HTTP was called HTTP1.1
In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP2 was created
HTTP2 solves several problems that creators of HTTP1.1 did not anticipate.
It is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack

Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP1.1-->

1) HTTP1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
2) In HTTP1.1 each request had to wait for a response before the next request Could be sent.
3) It relies on the transport layer to avoid buffer overflow, so each new TCP connection requires a separate flow control mechanism.
4) It is the binary framing layer.
5) It is a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server. 


HTTP2-->

1) HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
2) It uses multiplexing to allow multiple concurrent requests and responses over a single TCP Connection.
3) It multiplexes streams within a single TCP connection.
4) It uses a binary framing layer.
5) It is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1.
